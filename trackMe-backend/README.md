# trackMe

# Description

Tracking your own hours and the type of work you have done as an employee can be tedious. trackMe hopes to be an easy to use solution which will make this process more pleasant for you. 

The initial release of the project will be an offline application targetted for academic tutors and it will make logging repetitive data like class name, duration of class and topics taught on a fortnight basis much more streamline. However, with later releases trackMe will be operating as a web app whilst offering more flexibility that will be suitable for a variaty of occupations.


# Development Stages:

1. Web app capabilities for easy access
3. Capable of supporting more occupations
