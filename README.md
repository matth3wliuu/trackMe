# trackMe (work in progress)

---

### Motivation:

When I first started as a high school tutor at a small sized company, I found the experience of having to track my own hours and the work I have done to be really tedious. So, I came up with the idea for trackMe which aims to be an easy to use web application for improving employee experience.
